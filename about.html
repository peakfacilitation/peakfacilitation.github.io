                <p>Launched in 2010, <strong>Peak Facilitation Group</strong> is a small business devoted to conflict resolution
                    and rooted in reality. Her previous work in the field taught founder <strong>Heather Bergman</strong>                    that while most groups can find agreement, all groups benefit from respectful dialogue. Plus, she has
                    a gift for barking orders or gently nipping at a group’s heels…whichever is required.</p>

                    <p>Heather Bergman facilitates and mediates complex public policy deliberations on a variety of substantive
                        issues, including water quality, water quantity, watershed protection and restoration, land use planning,
                        and public lands management. These collaborative negotiations and discussions involve diverse stakeholders
                        from federal and state agencies, local municipalities, advocacy organizations, ranchers, farmers,
                        community residents, and the public at large.</p>
                    <p>Much of Heather’s work portfolio focuses on high-conflict collaborative processes, and her strength is
                        helping diverse and often opposing participants find common ground. Heather also has an extensive
                        background in designing and managing retreats, workshops, and public outreach meetings for teams
                        and organizations in need of a targeted process for achieving their goals. Heather uses humor to
                        defuse tense situations, help participants feel at ease, move beyond initial barriers, and find consensus.</p>

                        Throughout his academic and professional career, Samuel has sought to address complex
                        environmental issues by using collaborative techniques. As an AmeriCorps VISTA
                        Volunteer at Purgatoire Watershed Partnership, a watershed-focused non-profit located in
                        southern Colorado, he worked with a multi-interest stakeholder group which included local
                        municipalities, ranchers, development groups, federal and state agencies, recreationists,
                        and conservationists to approach problems facing the watershed. Following this
                        experience, he moved back to Denver where he is currently pursuing a MA in conflict
                        resolution at the University of Denver. He earned his bachelor’s degree at the University of
                        Michigan in environmental studies and political science.</p>
