                <p>Launched in 2010, <strong>Peak Facilitation Group</strong> is a small business devoted to conflict resolution
                    and rooted in reality. Her previous work in the field taught founder <strong>Heather Bergman</strong>                    that while most groups can find agreement, all groups benefit from respectful dialogue. Plus, she has
                    a gift for barking orders or gently nipping at a group’s heels…whichever is required.</p>

                    <p>Heather Bergman facilitates and mediates complex public policy deliberations on a variety of substantive
                        issues, including water quality, water quantity, watershed protection and restoration, land use
                        planning, and public lands management. These collaborative negotiations and discussions involve
                        diverse stakeholders from federal and state agencies, local municipalities, advocacy organizations,
                        ranchers, farmers, community residents, and the public at large.</p>
                    <p>Much of Heather’s work portfolio focuses on high-conflict collaborative processes, and her strength
                        is helping diverse and often opposing participants find common ground. Heather also has an extensive
                        background in designing and managing retreats, workshops, and public outreach meetings for teams
                        and organizations in need of a targeted process for achieving their goals. Heather uses humor
                        to defuse tense situations, help participants feel at ease, move beyond initial barriers, and
                        find consensus.</p>
