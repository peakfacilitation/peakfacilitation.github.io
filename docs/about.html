        <p>Launched in 2010, <strong>Peak Facilitation Group</strong> is a small business devoted to conflict resolution and rooted in reality. Her previous work in the field taught founder <strong>Heather Bergman</strong>                    that while most groups can find agreement, all groups benefit from respectful dialogue. Plus, she has a gift for barking orders or gently nipping at a group's heels…whichever is required.</p>
