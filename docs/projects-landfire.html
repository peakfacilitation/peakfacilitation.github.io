        <p>In 2018, the Colorado State Legislature established the Colorado Fire Commission to enhance the state's fire service capabilities and safeguard the well-being of Colorado's residents, assets, and natural resources. Commission members include various divisions of the State of Colorado, representatives for local fire chiefs and county sheriffs, professional and volunteer firefighter organizations, municipalities, utilities, federal agencies, and industry representatives. The Commission collaborates with subject matter experts to formulate recommendations for the State Legislature on fire risk reduction, community preparedness and resilience, firefighter training, and coordination among emergency response agencies. Since its inception, several of the Commission's recommendations have been adopted by the State Legislature and enacted into Colorado law. <em class="facilitator">Lead facilitator: Heather Bergman</em></p>

Through this initiative, USFS recreation staff have developed unique action plans for the White River National Forest, the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests and Pawnee National Grasslands, the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, and Gunnison National Forests, the Nebraska National Forests and Grasslands, and the Shoshone National Forest. By promoting strategic thinking and outlining specific, actionable steps, these plans aim to help each site maintain its focus on its overarching recreation goals, adapt more readily to unforeseen changes, and capitalize on emerging opportunities. <em class="facilitator">Lead facilitators: Heather Bergman and Samuel Wallace</em></p>

Based on these recommendations, the Jeffco Sheriff's Office Wildland Fire Management Program established the Wildland Fire Mitigation Working Group to provide a forum for county partners to collaboratively identify and prioritize wildfire mitigation treatment projects. Peak Facilitation helped launch the group and design a process for members to discuss and prioritize projects. In its first year, the Working Group developed a list of projects that the Sheriff's Office will use to prioritize support for cross-boundary projects across Jeffco. <em class="facilitator">Lead facilitator: Samuel Wallace</em></p>

The USPP uses the latest scientific data combined with local expertise to develop and implement landscape-scale, cross-boundary forest management projects. Partners have also created a shared geospatial database, worked together on large grant applications, and explored how to communicate their work to external audiences.

        <h3>Colorado Prescribed Fire Statewide Strategy</h3>
        <p>To address ongoing challenges to using prescribed fire as a land management and wildfire mitigation tool in Colorado, the Colorado Fire Commission (CFC) formed a Prescribed Fire Subcommittee to develop a statewide prescribed fire strategy. The Subcommittee, comprised of subject matter experts from non-profits, local fire protection districts, county commissioners, regional emergency responders, and forest land managers from various agencies, worked to pinpoint barriers and devise solutions. The Subcommittee engaged stakeholders statewide to learn about regional challenges and solicit ideas for change. Based on the input received, the Subcommittee composed a comprehensive statewide strategy that outlines administrative and legislative actions to increase the pace and scale of prescribed fire in Colorado. <em class="facilitator">Lead facilitator: Heather Bergman</em></p>

        <p>The Fountain Mutual Metro District (FMMD) convened a stakeholder group to explore future management options for a county road known as Goldfield Drive. Three concerns prompted the need for change: ongoing illegal activities along the road, expensive maintenance of a bridge, and the opportunity to integrate Goldfield Drive into a trail system that spans several local communities. Through a series of facilitated workshops, stakeholders examined the practical trade-offs of converting Goldfield Drive from a vehicle route to a trail, including traffic impacts, access for utilities and emergency services, maintenance costs and responsibilities, and recreation opportunities. The stakeholders reached consensus and developed a concept plan, which they will share with the community for additional input. <em class="facilitator">Lead facilitator: Samuel Wallace</em></p>

As federally managed public lands, meaningful public involvement in shaping national forest policies is crucial. The public engagement process provided stakeholders with the opportunity to share their visions for the Forest's future and to discuss the management of cultural and historic resources, energy and minerals, infrastructure, recreation, vegetation management, water, wilderness, and wildlife. These cross-disciplinary dialogues informed the content of the revised Forest Plan and, therefore, the management of the resources for years to come. <em class="facilitator">Lead facilitator: Heather Bergman</em></p>

        <p>The Carson National Forest in northern New Mexico acquired Miranda Canyon, a 5,000-acre area of forest, range, and riparian lands, from a private party. Miranda Canyon is a treasured natural and community resource. However, it has been subject to illegal dumping, drug use, haphazard gunfire, and other dangerous activities, and the US Forest Service faced difficulties regulating use without a management plan. The Forest convened a group of community stakeholders, including representatives from a local land grant, adjacent property owners, recreators, and environmental advocates, to develop a long-term management plan for Miranda. The Miranda Canyon Commission solicited community feedback to shape recommendations for this plan focused on recreation, road access, and the protection of the Canyon's natural and cultural resources. <em class="facilitator">Lead facilitator: Heather Bergman</em></p>
