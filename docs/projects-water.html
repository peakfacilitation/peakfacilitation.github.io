        <h3>Utah Lake Water Quality Study</h3>
        <p>Through a collaborative, science-based process, the Utah Lake Water Quality Study aims to determine target nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations that support Utah Lake's recreational, ecological, and agricultural uses as designated by the Clean Water Act. Natural factors and human impacts have contributed to elevated nutrient concentrations and harmful algal blooms in Utah's largest freshwater lake. Initiated by the Utah Division of Water Quality in 2015, the study is jointly conducted by a Science Panel of expert researchers and a Steering Committee of municipalities, state managers, wastewater treatment facilities, and other interest group representatives. The Study's multi-phase process has involved a comprehensive literature review, water quality data analysis and modeling, and stakeholder engagement to develop recommendations grounded in Utah Lake's local context. <em class="facilitator">Lead facilitators: Heather Bergman and Samuel Wallace</em></p>

        <h3>Grand County Stream Management Plan Update</h3>
        <p>The Grand County Stream Management Plan (GCSMP) was originally published in 2010 to address stream and aquatic habitat concerns. Grand County Learning by Doing (LBD), a partnership of municipal governments, water utilities, water users, state agencies, and conservation organizations, initiated the GCSMP update in 2022 to identify a new set of actionable projects to address ecosystem changes resulting from wildfires and pine beetle kill. Phase 1 of the update involved identifying local stakeholders' visions, goals, and concerns regarding stream conditions in the planning area through a facilitated engagement process. In Phase 2, LBD and stakeholders will identify priority stream reaches, develop stream and habitat improvement projects, and create an implementation plan to guide continued stream restoration and protection in Grand County. <em class="facilitator">Lead facilitator: Samuel Wallace</em></p>

        <h3>Boulder County Gross Reservoir Impacts Mitigation Fund Community Advisory Working Group</h3>
        <p>The Gross Reservoir Expansion Project Settlement Agreement between Boulder County and Denver Water directed Denver Water to pay $5 million to area residents to help mitigate noise, light, and air impacts associated with construction. Boulder County established a Community Advisory Working Group to recommend to the County Commissioners how to ensure the fair and equitable distribution of funds. Peak Facilitation supported Boulder County and the Community Advisory Working Group by organizing a recruitment process, designing the collaborative process, and facilitating in-room conversations. These efforts culminated in the Working Group submitting several recommendations to Boulder County Commissioners on how to fairly and equitably distribute funds, the majority of which were adopted. <em class="facilitator">Lead facilitator: Samuel Wallace</em></p>

        <h3>Grand County and North Fork of the Upper South Platte Wildfire Ready Action Plans</h3>
        <p>The Colorado Water Conservation Board created the Wildfire Ready Watersheds program to assess the susceptibility of Colorado's water resources, communities, and infrastructure to post-wildfire impacts. The program advances a framework for communities to proactively plan and implement strategies to mitigate these impacts. A key part of the program is developing local Wildfire Ready Action Plans (WRAPs) that assess post-fire hazards, identify values at risk, and elevate mitigation strategies. Peak Facilitation supported the development of a WRAP for Grand County and another for the North Fork of the Upper South Platte. Through collaborative meetings, stakeholders identified and prioritized risk-mitigation projects aligned with their values, ensuring their priorities were effectively incorporated into the final WRAP. <em class="facilitator">Lead facilitator: Samuel Wallace</em></p>
