        <p><strong>Community is more than a place</strong>; it is a feeling of being connected. This integration of people and places is at the heart of <strong>Peak community projects</strong>, which bring diverse groups together to create better places to live, work, and play. These projects explore the intersection of families, traditions, hobbies, and aspirations with local and regional public policy decisions.</p>

			<p>Heather worked with this group of committed potters, arts experts, and City staff who explored options to secure a sustainable future for Boulder’s treasured Pottery Lab. A valued community resource, the Pottery Lab faces budgetary challenges, which has raised questions about whether and how it can continue to be a part of the City’s recreational offerings. The working group investigated several options for the Pottery Lab’s future and delivered its recommendations for a public-private partnership to the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board in October 2012.

       		<div class="passage-text"><h3>Center for Excellence in Land Trust Conservation</h3>
			<p>In response to concern about the legitimacy of some conservation easements, the Colorado land trust community made the decision to take voluntary steps towards improving the quality of conservation easements and land conservation in the state. Heather facilitated the deliberations of the governing Commission of the Center for Excellence, comprised of more than 20 leaders in the land conservation community. Together, they identified ways to achieve new, community standards for land conservation and outlined a path of future steps to improve conservation work over time.</p></div>

			<p>In 2010, the Pikes Peak Area Council of Governments convened community and government leaders in Colorado’s El Paso and Teller Counties to develop a comprehensive regional sustainability plan. Heather facilitated both the decision-making Consensus Committee and the focus groups addressing energy and water, transportation, economic development, the environment, health, and recycling and procurement. This process actively engaged over 50 stakeholders to identify goals and strategies to transform the Pikes Peak region into a sustainability leader by 2030.

       		<div class="passage-text"><h3>Affordable Housing Task Force</h3>
			<p>Heather facilitated the deliberations of the Affordable Housing Task Force, a group of community stakeholders in Boulder exploring ways to meet the growing need for affordable housing in the city. The group’s deliberations touched on the provision of both rental and home ownership opportunities, as well as transportation, social service needs, environmental impacts, and financial constraints. Heather helped the Task Force to submit a final report to the City with recommendations for generating new revenues and establishing innovative programs and incentives to increase affordable housing.</p></div>
