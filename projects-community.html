                    together to create better places to live, work, and play. These projects explore the intersection of
                    families, traditions, hobbies, and aspirations with local and regional public policy decisions.</p>

                    <p>As the neutral, third-party mediation providers for the Douglas County Sheriff's Department, we work
                        with members of the community to identify appropriate and mutually agreeable solutions to issues
                        often stemming from miscommunication or lack of communication, such as noise disputes, dog issues,
                        or parking concerns. All mediators have completed 40 hours of mediation training. Mediation sessions
                        are confidential and neither discussions nor agreement specifics are shared with the Sheriff's Department.
                        For more information or to request mediation, contact <a href="http://www.dcsheriff.net/community/mediation/"

                    <h3>Jefferson County Summit</h3>
                    <p>The Jefferson County Summit creates a space for all elected officials within the County to share challenges
                        and ideas with others to foster an environment of collaboration. Some issues can be solved on a municipal
                        level, while other challenges, such as homelessness, transportation planning, and affordable housing
                        will require significant collaboration to make an impact. Heather guided roughly 60 elected officials
                        and staff in sharing information about what works in certain areas, as well as identifying universal
                        challenges that would require a County-wide effort. The information gathered at this meeting is being
                        used to inform future collaborative planning</p>

                    <h3>Marijuana Advisory Panel</h3>
                    <p>To create a more collaborative relationship between the agencies, organizations, and companies involved
                        in medical and recreational marijuana production and sales, the City of Boulder City Council appointed
                        an Advisory Panel to address some of the most pressing issues facing the community, the City, and
                        business owners. Heather worked with City staff to guide the 10-person panel through tough conversations
                        relating to enforcement, zoning, public health, and advertising. By the end of the process, the Advisory
                        Panel recommended over 30 consensus-based changes to City Code, of which a majority were adopted.

                    <h3>Nablus Working Group </h3>
                    <p>The Nablus Working Group was created by Boulder City Council to guide the Boulder community in a less
                        divisive direction regarding the Nablus Sister City application. Over the course of six months, Heather
                        worked with this 10-person, Council-appointed group to unpack the implications associated with the
                        application, including individual and community perspectives, hopes, frustrations, suggestions, and
                        ideas to ensure that whatever decision would be made by City Council would be as thoughtful and inclusive
                        as possible. This process resulted in a consensus report to council summarizing the issues and concerns
                        of the parties.</p>

                    <p>Heather facilitated the 21-member Citizens Capital Improvement Plan Committee, a community panel working
                        to prioritize capital improvement projects for the City of Arvada. Arvada is an older, diverse community
                        west of Denver faced with aging infrastructure in the areas of transportation, parks and recreation,
                        hospitality, and public safety while still working to keep up with resident demands for multi-modal
                        transportation corridors, a vibrant downtown, and transit-oriented development. Heather led the Committee
                        in prioritizing projects and making recommendations for ways the City could raise additional revenues
                        to support more community projects.</p>

                    <p>Heather worked with this group of committed potters, arts experts, and City staff who explored options
                        to secure a sustainable future for Boulder’s treasured Pottery Lab. A valued community resource,
                        the Pottery Lab faces budgetary challenges, which has raised questions about whether and how it can
                        continue to be a part of the City’s recreational offerings. The working group investigated several
                        options for the Pottery Lab’s future and delivered its recommendations for a public-private partnership
                        to the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board in October 2012.</p>

                    <p>In response to concern about the legitimacy of some conservation easements, the Colorado land trust community
                        made the decision to take voluntary steps towards improving the quality of conservation easements
                        and land conservation in the state. Heather facilitated the deliberations of the governing Commission
                        of the Center for Excellence, comprised of more than 20 leaders in the land conservation community.
                        Together, they identified ways to achieve new, community standards for land conservation and outlined
                        a path of future steps to improve conservation work over time.</p>

                    <p>In 2010, the Pikes Peak Area Council of Governments convened community and government leaders in Colorado’s
                        El Paso and Teller Counties to develop a comprehensive regional sustainability plan. Heather facilitated
                        both the decision-making Consensus Committee and the focus groups addressing energy and water, transportation,
                        economic development, the environment, health, and recycling and procurement. This process actively
                        engaged over 50 stakeholders to identify goals and strategies to transform the Pikes Peak region
                        into a sustainability leader by 2030.</p>

                        in Boulder exploring ways to meet the growing need for affordable housing in the city. The group’s
                        deliberations touched on the provision of both rental and home ownership opportunities, as well as
                        transportation, social service needs, environmental impacts, and financial constraints. Heather helped
                        the Task Force to submit a final report to the City with recommendations for generating new revenues
                        and establishing innovative programs and incentives to increase affordable housing.</p>
