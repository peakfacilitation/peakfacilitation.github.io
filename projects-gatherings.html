        <p><strong>Peak gatherings</strong> are smaller in scale but have big rewards. We customize our approach for each retreat, workshop, or public meeting to deliver a process and outcomes that make sense. If a team needs to regroup, a group needs to re-prioritize, or it’s a priority for the public to weigh in, <strong>Peak</strong> ensures that the gathering is a <strong>resounding success</strong>.

       		<div class="passage-text"><h3>Public Meetings</h3>
			<p>Engaging the public in a project can be daunting, particularly when substantial controversy or technical complexity exists. There are challenges related to making meetings meaningful for participants, ensuring that goals are met, translating studies into understandable information, and doing it all without taking public comment until the wee hours of the morning. Peak excels at delivering public meetings that help clients get the feedback they need while engaging the public in a meaningful way. We achieve this through thoughtful integration of plenary presentations, small group discussions, written comment, online surveys, and/or electronic polling.</p></div>

       		<div class="passage-text"><h3>Retreats</h3>
			<p>Boards of directors, city councils, and management or leadership teams all benefit from retreats as opportunities to step back, take stock, and make a plan for the future. Governance retreats often involve visioning, strategic planning, goal setting, prioritizing, work plan construction, problem solving, and/or celebration. Retreats range from half-day check-ins to two-day dig-ins, and Peak’s approach is to ensure that the desired outcomes are achieved in every case. No matter if the group is public or private, for-profit or nonprofit, Peak is committed to retreats that add value to an organization.

       		<div class="passage-text"><h3>Workshops</h3>
			<p>Organizations of all kinds encounter questions or problems that require a focused, outcome-oriented discussion by a small group. Sometimes these workshops are internal efforts to begin a new initiative, debrief a past event, or brainstorm options for pursuing a project. Other workshops are focused on bringing in key stakeholders to explore ways of addressing challenging public issues like urban infill, community visions, or government responses to a crisis. Through visioning exercises, design charrettes, Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analyses, and managed dialogue, Peak assists teams in finding answers. </p></div>
