						<p>The Front Range Roundtable is a coalition of individuals from state and federal agencies, local governments, environmental and conservation organizations, the academic and scientific communities, and industry and user groups, all with a commitment to forest health and fire risk mitigation along Colorado’s Front Range. The Roundtable is focused on community and watershed protection and the restoration of more ecologically resilient conditions for the future and serves as the implementing and monitoring multi-party group for Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Projects (CFLRP) on the Front Range. Heather is working with the Roundtable to define a vision for the future by identifying group structure, decision-making processes, and priorities, while continuing to effectively execute current tasks.</p>

						<p>The US Forest Service is revising the Rio Grande National Forest Plan, the document that guides management of the Rio Grande National Forest in southern Colorado. As the forest is an important natural and community resource, engaging the public in a meaningful way throughout the plan revision process is critical. Heather worked with staff from the US Forest Service and the National Forest Foundation to develop and implement exciting new public engagement opportunities that will allow stakeholders throughout the San Luis Valley to not only give their opinions on the future of the forest, but also to engage in constructive dialogue on key issues with individuals who have different visions for and uses of the forest. These cross-sector stakeholder dialogues will inform all phases of the plan revision process.</p>

					<p>The Upper South Platte Partnership is a collaborative group focused on forest health, watershed resilience, fire-adapted communities, and safe and effective fire response. The Partnership plans on using new data, modeling, and spatial analysis tools, combined with local knowledge, to identify areas across the Upper South Platte watershed where forest management could most effectively contribute to the group’s watershed and wildfire risk reduction objectives.  Heather is working with the group to create and execute protocols and decision-making methods to ensure balanced and in-depth discussions that meet the expectations of the diverse parties involved, as well as a shared vision of success and evaluation methodologies for assessing and funding projects that can help achieve that vision.</p>
