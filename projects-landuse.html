       		<div class="passage-text"><h3>Center for Excellence in Land Trust Conservation</h3>
			<p>In response to concern about the legitimacy of some conservation easements, the Colorado land trust community decided to take voluntary steps towards improving the quality of conservation easements and land conservation in the state. Heather facilitated the deliberations of the governing Commission of the Center for Excellence, comprised of more than 20 leaders in the land conservation community. Together, they identified ways to achieve new, community standards for land conservation and outlined a path of future steps to improve conservation work over time. </p></div>

			<p>Heather facilitated a pilot project in the Pikes Peak region to develop a long-range transportation plan through a collaborative stakeholder process. Local, state, and federal representatives worked with staff of the Metropolitan Planning Organization to develop a vision, mission, and goals for the transportation plan. This process resulted in a new, comprehensive transportation plan that better reflects the vision and needs of region residents, planning partners, and regulatory agencies.</p></div>

			<p>Heather facilitated the deliberations of the Community Collaborative Group (CCG), a diverse group of stakeholders working to prepare consensus recommendations to the Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks department regarding trail location, recreational use, and natural resource conservation. The group gathered their input into a comprehensive land use plan for 12,000 acres of grassland, foothills, and mountains that serve as Boulder’s visual backdrop.</p></div>

			<p>Heather facilitated the deliberations of the Fountain Creek Vision Task Force in southern Colorado as they sought agreement on how to restore the 930-square-mile Fountain Creek watershed. The watershed covers three counties and includes several towns and cities, substantial agricultural land, and a large military base. Effective dialogue was needed among this diverse group of stakeholders. Heather facilitated a collaborative process that resulted in a detailed watershed management plan and the creation of a watershed district by the Colorado Legislature.</p></div>

			<p>Heather facilitated the stakeholder deliberation process in this controversial effort to design an urban infill redevelopment project on the site of a closed elementary school in Boulder, Colorado. Neighbors of the site had concerns about the development’s impact on parking, home values, neighborhood feel, and quality of life. The City of Boulder had requirements regarding historic building preservation, provision of affordable housing, solar access, and density. Heather helped the stakeholders to reconcile these often competing demands into a consensus list of guiding principles for the developer.</p></div>

			<p>Heather co-facilitated a pre-planning process for the BLM that sought to engage local governments in discussions about the future of federal public lands in north-central Colorado. Sitting down with staff and elected officials from towns, cities, and counties in the state, Heather gathered input on how residents use public lands and how they thought these resources should be managed. The BLM used the final report for its pre-planning efforts and the revision of the area’s resource management plan.</p></div>

			<p>Heather co-facilitated the negotiations of NWCOS, a diverse group of community stakeholders who came up with a “community alternative” for inclusion in a BLM draft resource management plan. This collaborative community visioning approach helped the stakeholders see the complexities of the land use planning process and the challenges inherent in planning for multiple (often competing) uses, including wilderness designation, energy development, habitat and species protection, and both motorized and non-motorized recreation.</p></div>
