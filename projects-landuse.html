                    <h3>Washington School Site Design Process</h3>
                    <p>Heather facilitated the stakeholder deliberation process in this controversial effort to design an urban
                        infill redevelopment project on the site of a closed elementary school in Boulder, Colorado. Neighbors
                        of the site had concerns about the development’s impact on parking, home values, neighborhood feel,
                        and quality of life. The City of Boulder had requirements regarding historic building preservation,
                        provision of affordable housing, solar access, and density. Heather helped the stakeholders to reconcile
                        these often competing demands into a consensus list of guiding principles for the developer.</p>

                    <h3>Bureau of Land Management (BLM)<br />Community Assessments in North Central Colorado</h3>
                    <p>Heather co-facilitated a pre-planning process for the BLM that sought to engage local governments in
                        discussions about the future of federal public lands in north-central Colorado. Sitting down with
                        staff and elected officials from towns, cities, and counties in the state, Heather gathered input
                        on how residents use public lands and how they thought these resources should be managed. The BLM
                        used the final report for its pre-planning efforts and the revision of the area’s resource management
                        plan.

                    <h3>Northwest Colorado Stewardship (NWCOS)</h3>
                    <p>Heather co-facilitated the negotiations of NWCOS, a diverse group of community stakeholders who came
                        up with a “community alternative” for inclusion in a BLM draft resource management plan. This collaborative
                        community visioning approach helped the stakeholders see the complexities of the land use planning
                        process and the challenges inherent in planning for multiple (often competing) uses, including wilderness
                        designation, energy development, habitat and species protection, and both motorized and non-motorized
                        recreation.
