                    <p>The Water Efficiency Working Group (WEWG) was created by Denver Water to bring recommendations to the
                        Denver Water Board of Commissioners regarding how to define efficient water use, create benchmarks
                        for efficiency, and develop tactics to improve consumer water use. WEWG members represented a diversity
                        of water users including municipalities, parks, schools, landscape companies, environmental advocates,
                        community advocates, private businesses, and others. Through 10 months of meetings dedicated to learning
                        about water conservation issues and challenges and then discussing options and ideas, WEWG members
                        delivered consensus recommendations to the Denver Water Board. These recommendations are included
                        in Denver Water’s new Water Efficiency Plan.</p>

                    <h3>Interbasin Compact Committee</h3>
                    <p>The Interbasin Compact Committee (IBCC) members represent nine basin roundtables and additional stakeholders
                        in statewide water issues, working to address long-term water supply challenges while balancing the
                        needs of utility providers, agricultural producers, industrial users, the recreation economy, and
                        the environment. With Heather's help, the IBCC reached a groundbreaking agreement on a conceptual
                        framework for the development of a new transmountain diversion benefitting to communities on both
                        sides of the Continental Divide. This draft framework was included in the final draft of Colorado’s
                        Water Plan.</p>

                    <p>The Watershed Health Working Group brought together municipal and agricultural water users with representatives
                        from local, state, federal, and non-governmental organizations to share lessons learned from recent
                        fires and floods and to explore the interconnected relationship between watershed health and water
                        supplies. This interbasin, interagency collaborative group identified watershed health management
                        priorities for the protection of water supplies and uses and established protocols for communication
                        and collaboration during future fire and flooding events.</p>

                    <p>This dialogue was initiated to facilitate agricultural fallowing and water sharing agreements between
                        municipalities, farmers, and ranchers. A group of water experts and agricultural and municipal water
                        users explored policy changes that can make such agreements less burdensome on the agricultural community
                        while increasing the certainty that municipalities will have water to meet future demands. Heather
                        facilitated the dialogue with a focus on improving the overall policy landscape for water sharing.</p>

                    <p>The South Platte Flows Dialogue brought together municipalities and other stakeholders in Arapahoe County
                        with water providers and agricultural users participating in the Chatfield Reallocation Project.
                        Specifically, the group explored ways in which the water stored in Chatfield Reservoir can meet regional
                        water supply needs while also keeping the South Platte River healthy. Heather facilitated the group’s
                        discussions about creating a voluntary flow management agreement to ensure stream water is available
                        when and where it is needed most.</p>

                        nine basins and other water stakeholders about a potential new water supply project at Flaming Gorge
                        Reservoir. Heather facilitated the Committee’s work to identify the interests and issues potentially

                        for cooperative water use between the City of Greeley and the North Weld Water Conservancy District
                        within Greeley’s 2060 Long-Range Expected Growth Boundary. After identifying shared interests, brainstorming
                        solutions, and using several scenarios to evaluate the practicality of the proposed solutions, the
                        Working Group developed a water-sharing agreement that will integrate their two systems and implement
                        two-way master metering to allow for flexible water use and efficient delivery to their users.</p>

                        covers three counties and includes several towns and cities, substantial agricultural land, and a
                        large military base. Effective dialogue was needed among this diverse group of stakeholders. Heather
                        facilitated a collaborative process that resulted in a detailed watershed management plan and the
