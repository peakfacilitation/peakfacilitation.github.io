        <p>In the West, <strong>our lives and livelihoods</strong> depend on safe and sufficient water supplies to meet the needs of human and natural communities. <strong>Peak water projects</strong> bring providers, farmers, ranchers, environmental advocates, and everyday water users together to develop and protect supplies, maximize use of existing resources, maintain quality, and restore stream systems.

			<p>This dialogue was initiated to facilitate agricultural fallowing and water sharing agreements between municipalities, farmers, and ranchers. A group of water experts and agricultural and municipal water users is exploring policy changes that can make such agreements less burdensome on the agricultural community while increasing the certainty that municipalities will have water to meet future demands. Heather facilitates the dialogue with a focus on improving the overall policy landscape for water sharing.</p></div>

			<p>The South Platte Flows Dialogue is bringing together municipalities and other stakeholders in Arapahoe County with water providers and agricultural users participating in the Chatfield Reallocation Project. Specifically, the group is exploring ways in which the water stored in Chatfield Reservoir can meet regional water supply needs while also keeping the South Platte River healthy. Heather facilitates the group’s discussions about creating a voluntary flow management agreement to ensure stream water is available when and where it is needed most.</p></div>

			<p>Heather facilitates the ongoing deliberations of the Interbasin Compact Committee (IBCC), established by Colorado statute to streamline conversations among Colorado’s river basins and to address statewide water issues. The 27 members of the IBCC represent nine basin roundtables and additional stakeholders in statewide water issues. The IBCC meets regularly to discuss options for meeting the state’s anticipated municipal and industrial water supply gap in ways that maintain existing uses, address environmental needs, and build on local knowledge, entities, and processes.</p></div>

			<p>This pilot project was launched to determine the effectiveness of collaborative dialogue among Colorado’s nine basins and other water stakeholders about a potential new water supply project at Flaming Gorge Reservoir. Heather facilitates the Committee’s work to identify the interests and issues potentially impacted by such a project and is helping to develop next steps in the process.

			<p>Heather facilitated the deliberations of the Fountain Creek Vision Task Force in southern Colorado as they sought agreement on how to restore the 930-square-mile Fountain Creek watershed. The watershed covers three counties and includes several towns and cities, substantial agricultural land, and a large military base. Effective dialogue was needed among this diverse group of stakeholders. Heather facilitated a collaborative process that resulted in a detailed watershed management plan and the creation of a watershed district by the Colorado Legislature.</p></div>

			<p>Heather worked with a collaborative group of ranchers, farmers, municipalities, environmental advocates, and the State of Colorado to create a constructive dialogue about the benefits and challenges of Wild and Scenic eligibility and designation. Participants identified management options for protecting the remarkable values and current uses along the eligible stream segments.</p></div>
