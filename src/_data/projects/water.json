    "description": "Through a collaborative, science-based process, the Utah Lake Water Quality Study aims to determine target nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations that support Utah Lake's recreational, ecological, and agricultural uses as designated by the Clean Water Act. Natural factors and human impacts have contributed to elevated nutrient concentrations and harmful algal blooms in Utah's largest freshwater lake. Initiated by the Utah Division of Water Quality in 2015, the study is jointly conducted by a Science Panel of expert researchers and a Steering Committee of municipalities, state managers, wastewater treatment facilities, and other interest group representatives. The Study's multi-phase process has involved a comprehensive literature review, water quality data analysis and modeling, and stakeholder engagement to develop recommendations grounded in Utah Lake's local context.",

    "description": "The Colorado Rivermap is a collaborative planning effort to elevate innovative solutions to the challenges facing Colorado's rivers, including crowded recreation sites, degraded ecosystems, and safety risks to recreators. The project unites a broad coalition of stakeholders from the recreation industry, agricultural community, state and federal management agencies, and nonprofit organizations. The Rivermap aims to build on proven successes and leverage existing expertise, while also facilitating regional knowledge sharing to foster the development of new, creative approaches to river management. Ultimately, the Rivermap will propose strategies to improve stewardship and safety on Colorado's recreational rivers, identify local projects for future investment, and build a durable stakeholder network to advance the Rivermap's plans toward on-the-ground implementation.",

    "description": "The Grand County Stream Management Plan (GCSMP) was originally published in 2010 to address stream and aquatic habitat concerns. Grand County Learning by Doing (LBD), a partnership of municipal governments, water utilities, water users, state agencies, and conservation organizations, initiated the GCSMP update in 2022 to identify a new set of actionable projects to address ecosystem changes resulting from wildfires and pine beetle kill. Phase 1 of the update involved identifying local stakeholders' visions, goals, and concerns regarding stream conditions in the planning area through a facilitated engagement process. In Phase 2, LBD and stakeholders will identify priority stream reaches, develop stream and habitat improvement projects, and create an implementation plan to guide continued stream restoration and protection in Grand County.",

The program advances a framework for communities to proactively plan and implement strategies to mitigate these impacts. A key part of the program is developing local Wildfire Ready Action Plans (WRAPs) that assess post-fire hazards, identify values at risk, and elevate mitigation strategies. Peak Facilitation supported the development of a WRAP for Grand County and another for the North Fork of the Upper South Platte. Through collaborative meetings, stakeholders identified and prioritized risk-mitigation projects aligned with their values, ensuring their priorities were effectively incorporated into the final WRAP.",
