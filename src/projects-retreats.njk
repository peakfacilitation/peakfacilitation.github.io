  text: "<p><strong>Peak retreats</strong> are smaller in scale but have big rewards. We work with city councils, boards of directors, leadership teams, and organizations of all sizes to design customized processes for retreats, workshops, or public meetings. If a team needs to regroup, a group needs to re-prioritize, or it's a priority for the public to weigh in, <strong>Peak</strong> ensures that the gathering is a <strong>success</strong>.</p>"
